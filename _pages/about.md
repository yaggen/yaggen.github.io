## Me.

I'm 23 years old, currently studying Network technology and IT-security at University West in Trollhättan, previously finnished a 1.5 year IT-security technician program at EC Utbildning (HVE) in Malmö.


In my spare time i like to hack on different CTF challenges such as [HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.eu), [Vulnhub](https://vulnhub.com) or at live events, i aslo often work on one or multiple personal projects when there is time.


## This site.

This site is supposed to work as some type of portfolio/extension to my CV when applying for jobs, **and** hopefully as a work log for myself to look back on regarding labs, challenges, code or really any project. I also believe one of the best learning techniques is to try to write about something and learn other people.
